README for ATM-RTM with petList NUOPC prototype and two time scales
NUOPC prototype
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Show how a Driver can setup a run sequence with two time scales


Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver (ESM), four model components
  (ATM, RTM, OCN, ICE)
  
  The ESM driver uses explicitly constructed petLists when adding the ATM, RTM, OCN, ICE

  The ESM driver constructs a custom run sequence with two time scales to
  implement coupling between ATM, RTM, OCN, ICE
  
  The connector components are explicitly added by the driver.
  
  ATM, RTM, OCN, ICE consisting of advertise and realize.

  The RTM component is from ../../install/rrtmg.mk makefile segment. The RTM component accepts 
  Mesh from ATM and builds the 6 export Fields. The 6 export Fields are transferred to ATM
  through redistribution using default NUOPC connector. The run sequence of ATM and RTM
  are specified in esmApp.runconfig

  Initial Mesh in ATM is created from a 2.5 degree gridfile at:
  cd data
  wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feiliuesmf/esmftest/master/xgrid/test1/ll2.5deg_grid.nc

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np 8 ./esmApp
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ice.F90     - The ICE component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver. Define partial petLists for
                  ATM, RTM, OCN, ICE, and MED; Set custom RunSequence with two 
                  timescales: slow interaction w/ RTM & fast interaction w/ ATM.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM application.
